Objective : 
	To run computational chemistry calculations with ORCA, input (.xyz file, .inp file (having instructions of the simulation),slurm input) of 1-24 number of 
	Li atoms on top of NTCDA and preferabbly half the number of Li ions on top of NTCDA. We will have this number as input
Subprocesses : 
	(i) Take this number N(a) and N(i) as number of Lithium atoms and ions. First make a folder for these two sets of atom types and then the number
	of subfolders requested by the users.
	(ii) Copy input files to these subfolders from head folder.
	(iii) Make changes in these input files ---
	As we are copying these files, after the copying is done we are supposed to be changing these subfolders and then make the following changes ---
		1. Change the multiplicity of .inp files 
		2. Add the the number of Li ions/atoms based on the index number
		3. Change their geometry of Li ions/ atoms 
		4. Change the name of job name and scratch folder in the slurm files
		5. Submit the job slurm job
		6. After submitting the job, come back to the subfolder perhaps
	(iv) Come back to the subfolder. Run parameter_extractor for NBO analysis
